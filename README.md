**Onedrive_blockedfileshandler**
Display a list of all unauthorized files in OneDrive, allowing bulk selection to either rename or move them to a location other than Desktop, Documents, or Pictures.  

*This simplifies error resolution for users by providing an interface where all problematic files are listed, enabling batch actions instead of manually locating and fixing each file.*
